My name is David and I'm a web developer, technical author and musician from Ireland.

I'm always working on one project or another. Being creative is not only a core part of my mental health regimen; it's essentially how I stay sane (in an increasingly dystopic reality). What also helps is that I am an extremely proud papai of a beautiful Brazilian-Irish boy, and an ever-grateful husband to a wonderful wife and mulher maravilhosa.

I have [one book to my name](/generative-art-javascript-svg/) so far, on the subject of Generative Art (**not** the AI kind - if you're curious about my views on AI [see here](/tag/ai/)). I've released a few EPs and an album with the independent Irish label Inner Chapter Music, and am currently working on a solo piano album.

On the code side of things, I maintain [some WordPress plugins](https://profiles.wordpress.org/davidmatthew/#content-plugins) (though I now primarily work in Drupal and Eleventy - the latter is what this site runs on), created the SvJs JavaScript library for generative artists (which I use for the examples in my book on the same subject), and have more recently been focussed on MusicXML and web audio.
